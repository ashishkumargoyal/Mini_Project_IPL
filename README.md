# IPL Data Analysis - EDA

## Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Indian Premier League (IPL) dataset. The dataset consists of two main files: the **Deliveries Dataset** and the **Match Dataset**. The goal is to analyze key statistics, trends, and insights related to match outcomes, team performance, player achievements, and toss decisions across multiple IPL seasons.

## Datasets
1. **Deliveries Dataset**: Contains detailed delivery-wise data of every match in IPL.
2. **Match Dataset**: Provides match-level data, including teams, toss results, and final outcomes.

## Analysis & Findings
The analysis addresses the following key questions:
- Match statistics per season (count, runs, and average runs per match).
- Toss-related statistics: team performance post-toss and toss win correlation.
- Team performance: highest winning percentage, team with most matches played, etc.
- Player achievements: leading run-scorers, wicket-takers, and boundary statistics.
- In-depth team comparison in various match situations (first 6 overs, last 4 overs).

## Visualizations

- Toss decision trends across seasons.
- Player statistics (fours, sixes, strike rates).
- Team performance in high-scoring matches (200+ scores).
